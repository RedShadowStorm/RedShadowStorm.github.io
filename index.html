    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
        
    <p>The purpose of our experiment was to examine which parachute shape would be the  best. Our &ldquo;best&rdquo; is not black and white, seeing that some people need fast fall velocities, (though that velocity should not be enough to kill them) for the thrill of falling at high speeds. There is also the factor of how accurate of how accurately a parachute can take its payload to its intended target.</p>
    
    <h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
    <p>We must keep the surface area of every parachute canopy we will be using, we will also keep the number of strings attached to every parachute constant (8 strings) as well so that equal amounts of force are exerted on every parachute canopy. We also used the exact same 20 gram weight for every trial of the parachutes. The independent variables we will be changing are the shape of the parachute and the string length of the parachute and the regularity of the shapes we are using. We will not be changing the heights of which we are dropping the parachute from. The dependant variables are the fall times and fall velocities of each parachute as well as the stability of the fall (how straight the fall is).</p>
    
    <h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>We expect that circles will provide the slowest fall velocity because they spread the air out equally around the entire parachute canopy because they have no angles because they have no straight sides. We also expect that all the regular shaped parachute canopies will provide more of a stable fall (more accurate) with less diagonal fall.</p>

    <h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut fifty-six 22 cm long segments of thread</li>
        <li>Draw an equilateral triangle (with 60 degree angles and sides of 42.6cm) graft two 8xll sheets on the 11 side, and attach another 8xll sheet on top with the middle of the 11 sheet at the place where the 2 previous sheets were attached.</li>
        <li>Cut the equilateral triangle out</li>
        <li>Draw another triangle with 3 8xll papers all attached on the 11 side, this one being irregular with its height set at 28 cm  and a base of 56 cm</li>
        <li>Cut it out</li>
        <li>Draw a regular square that has the dimensions of 28x28 Graft 2 8xll sheets (tape them on the 11 side) (make sure that the 28 is exactly in the center of the sheet)</li>
        <li>Cut it out</li>
        <li>Draw a regular hexagon (with 120 degree angles and sides of 17.4) on a paper that was grafted in the same way as the triangle) (make the base of the triangle tangent to the bottom of the sheet of paper) (make sure that the bottom edge&srquo; bisector is exactly where the 2 grafted papers meet (the ones that were attached on the 11’ side))</li>
        <li>Draw a regular Octagon (with 135 degree angles and sides of 12.6) on a paper that was grafted in the same way as the Hexagon) (make the base of the triangle tangent to the bottom of the sheet of paper) (make sure that thes bottom edge&srquo; bisector is exactly where the 2 grafted papers meet (the ones that were attached on the 11’ side) ) draw a circle with a compass (with a radius of 15.8 cm)</li>
        <li>Cut the octagon out</li>
        <li>Draw a circle with a compass (with a radius of 15.8 cm)</li>
        <li>Cut the circle out</li>
        <li>Attach 8 strings to every shape, also the strings (not including the part that is being covered in tape) should always be 30 cm long have a centimeter of tape attaching it to the top of the parachute canopy and to connect all the strings together use another half centimeter of tape to connect all of the lines (on each individual parachute). Attach the strings in the following configurations:</li>
        <dl>
            <dt>Equilateral triangle</dt>
            <dt>square</dt>
                <dd>Tape one string on every vertice then secure the remaining four to the midpoints of the edges.</dd>
            <dt>Hexagon</dt>
<dd>Tape one string for every vertice, and then attach the remaining two to any opposite side within the hexagon.</dd>
            <dt>Octagon</dt>
            <dd>Tape one string for every vertice.</dd>
            <dt>Circle</dt>
            <dd>Place the strings at equal distances along the circumference (every 12.4 cm along the approximately 99.3 cm circumference)</dd>
        </dl>
<li>Drop the parachutes in this order in a 250 cm tall room touch the payload (20g weight) to the light that is 30 cms below the ceiling (220cms from the ground). Drop them with a 20 gram weights on the bottom and immediately when you drop them start the timer and when the payload touches the ground, stop the timer, drop them in the following order:</li>
        <ul style=inside>
    <li>1) Equilateral triangle</li>
    <li>2) Square</li>
    <li>3) Hexagon</li>
    <li>4) Octagon</li>
    <li>5) Circle</li>
        </ul>
<li>Repeat step 14 Three more times</li>
<li>Find the average of the 4 trials (4 per parachute)</li>
<li>Calculate the Average fall time of every parachute shape</li>
<li>Calculate the average fall velocity of every shape with distance (220 cm) over(divided by)
time. Calculate the average fall times of the regular shapes as well as the irregular shapes</li>
 
    </ol>
    </div>
    <h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>
    <p>We observed that the slower the fall velocity the more unstable the parachute (going off target to places that were far off from the area, crashing into walls where it would be expected to land).This because too much drag is created so more upwards force is being applied on the parachute leading the parachute and its payload away from the predicted landing trajectory. We also observed that after every test the strings attaching the parachute canopy to the payload got tangled, and we had to untangle them so that the parachute (on the next trial) would not go spinning off into the wall. A trend we noticed is that the more sides the shape had the slower fall velocity. The only shape this is not true to that even though the circle has the most sides, it did have a faster fall velocity than the Octagon and Hexagon.  We also observed that on the shapes with fewer sides when we put the strings on they were a further distance from the centre than for the canopies with more sides (ex: Octagon and Circle).</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Our experiment supported our Hypothesis in the fact that the shapes with more sides had slower fall velocities, but this was not true if the parachute shape is a circle.  We conclude that the Octagon has the slowest fall velocity as a parachute shape. This is because it catches more air on the way down and causing it to have more lift. We also found that it is very important. Being that catching air is equal to more drag and, drag is the force parachutes rely on to slow themselves down with. When there is too much drag, our parachutes would go off target and slam into the walls. As a next step we could also experiment about if varying the string length of a parachute would have any effect as well as testing if having vents on the Parachute canopy. In this experiment we used a stopwatch to measure the fall times of the parachutes, this wouldn’t be as accurate as using electrical pulses to dictate when to start and stop the stopwatch. For this we would have covered the floor with aluminum foil, and had a little compartment with metal legs wired to a battery within the compartment, the tinfoil would be wired to a hacked stopwatch to dictate when the stopwatch ends the timer. Also, to tell the stopwatch when to stop we would have used a photo resistor that would be placed in the line of sight of a laser, when the photo resistor doesn’t detect the light the electricity won’t flow through, we would then wire this to a relay that would power the start button of the stopwatch. Unfortunately, we did not have the time to actually put this plan into effect.</p>
